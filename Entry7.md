# Entry 7: Why Haskell?
Haskell is infamous for its somewhat small community and steep learning curve which drives many newcomers away early on. In this blog I would like to share some reasons for why learning Haskell may be worth it for you.
### Library Availability
Though the userbase for Haskell is far more limited than more mainstream languages such as Python or C++, Haskell hosts a solid database of over 9000 packages it its repository named Hackage. This collection may not seem so extensive when compared to other languages, but there are more than enough packages for the vast majority of user needs (not to mention the database is still growing rather quickly).
### The Learning Curve
As stated before, the learning curve for Haskell is quite steep which can be a major deterrent for many people. However, many will find that the payout for even attempting to learn Haskell is great. While learning Haskell you train your brain to think in new ways in order to write efficient code and utilize the language to its fullest abilities. In doing this you be able to work in high levels of abstraction and separating pure code. Your skills and knowledge of not only Haskell, but programming languages in general will improve and you can carry those skills anywhere in the industry.
### Testing
When writing code in Haskell, testing is made incredibly easy thanks to features such as purity, lazy evaluation, and high level abstraction. Hackage offers several libraries that can be used for testing as well, namely QuickCheck and SmallCheck.
### Reusability
The last point I would like to discuss in this blog is the reusability of code. Expressive type systems and high level abstraction are very common throughout Haskell programs which makes using components for other projects much easier. Oftentimes patterns in code will be abstracted out and able to be applied elsewhere rather than everything being hard coded in like other languages.
