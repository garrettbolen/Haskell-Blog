# Haskell vs Python
In this entry I would like to go over some key differences between Haskell and a language many of you may be more familiar with, Python.
### Functional vs imperative
One of the main differences between Haskell and Python is that Haskell is a functional programming language while Python is imperative with some declarative capability. While Haskell is capable of procedural programming via monads, it isn't really designed for that nor is it particularly good at it. Python is much more flexible than Haskell as it supports procedural, functional, and object oriented programming. Personally, I would rather use Python for procedural and object oriented programming, but that comes to no surprise as Haskell is known for being a strong purely functional language with little emphasis elsewhere.
### Compiled vs interpreted
Another key difference is that Haskell is a compiled language while Python is usually interpreted. For this reason, Python is able to have dynamic typing, which we will discuss in the next section. This also means that Python code is platform independent as the interpreter handles the execution of the program, not the machine. However, compiled languages are known to be faster than interpreted languages and this is no exception when it comes to Haskell. This does come at the cost though of not only having platform dependence, but also the need to compile code each time before testing.
### Static vs Dynamic typing
While both Haskell and Python are strongly typed languages, there is a key difference between the two. Haskell has static typing while Python has dynamic typing. This means that every variable in Haskell must have a type at compile time whereas in Python the type will not be known until runtime. 
### Spacing
This is a minor difference, but in Python whitespace is important to the syntax, where in Haskell whitespace does nothing but enhance readability.
### Learning difficulty
Many people have reported that Haskell has a much steeper learning curve than Python, to which I agree. This is thanks to the functional nature of Haskell, something that isn't usually taught early on to someone learning how to code. The most popular programming languages are all imperative so many people, myself included, are most comfortable with that style. It's a lot easier to switch from imperative language to imperative language, but picking up a functional language for the first time introduces a lot of challenges. However, once you begin to understand it and learn to approach things from a functional perspective, it isn't so bad.
