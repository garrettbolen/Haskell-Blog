# Entry 8: Useful Haskell Packages
There are many packages that come with Haskell, so here I would like to list some of the more useful ones:
-   [Alex](https://www.haskell.org/alex/)  - a lexical analyser generator for Haskell.
-   [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)  - a system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs.
-   [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)  - the state-of-the-art optimizing native code compiler for Haskell.
-   [GHCi](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/ghci.html)  - a bytecode interpreter and interactive REPL environment for Haskell.
-   [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/)  - the Haskell community's central package archive.
-   [Haddock](https://www.haskell.org/haddock/)  - a tool for automatically generating documentation from annotated Haskell source code.
-   [Happy](https://www.haskell.org/happy/)  - The Parser Generator for Haskell.
-   [Hayoo](http://hayoo.fh-wedel.de/)  - will search all packages from Hackage, including all function and type definitions.
-   [Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/)  - a Haskell API search engine, which allows you to search many standard Haskell libraries by either function name, or by approximate type signature.
-   [hsenv](https://github.com/Paczesiowa/hsenv/)  - a tool to create isolated Haskell environments. This allows a project to use a GHC version different of the currently installed.
-   [Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack)  - a cross-platform tool to help on building Haskell projects. It includes support to create isolated Haskell environments and to automatically manage the dependencies of a project.
-   [Stackage](https://github.com/fpco/stackage)  - "Stable Hackage," tools for creating a vetted set of packages from Hackage.
-   [The Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/contents.html)  - a comprehensive, robust development environment for programming in Haskell.
