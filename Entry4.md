# Entry 4: Resources for learning Haskell
In this entry I would like to share some of the resources that have best aided me in learning Haskell so far.

These resources have been really helpful in learning many of the basic concepts of Haskell. The first is the [Happy Learn Haskell Tutorial](http://www.happylearnhaskelltutorial.com/contents.html). This site covers all of the basics you will need in order to start your journey of learning Haskell. Not only does it give nice visuals and easy to understand descriptions of things, but it also provides real world connections and applications throughout.

The next tutorial I use often is [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters). This tutorial is another one that does a great job of explaining things in a way that even absolute beginners can understand. Some tutorials are really dense and expect coding background to start, but this one provides explanations for everything you're doing and why you are doing it. Overall, it makes the process feel a lot less daunting and I highly recommend it.

The third resources is a book that can be found online for free titled [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/). Where the other tutorials are very basic and easy to understand, this book takes it a step further and goes into a little more detail. That being said, it doesn't do so in a way that overwhelms you and it's still a great resource for beginners. The one thing I would say though before going into this book is to take a look at the previous tutorials first to give yourself a basic understanding of some of the contents because this is more of an official publication on the subject.
